## Project 1: Y. Music Preferences

In this data analysis project, we explore the music preferences of users in Springfield and Shelbyville using real Y.Music data. Our primary objectives include investigating how user activity varies across days and cities, discerning city-specific genre preferences during Monday mornings and Friday nights, and exploring the hypothesis of divergent musical tastes between the two citiesâ€”pop music in Springfield and rap in Shelbyville. Through meticulous analysis, we aim to uncover patterns that not only enhance our understanding of user behavior but also provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the music industry.
