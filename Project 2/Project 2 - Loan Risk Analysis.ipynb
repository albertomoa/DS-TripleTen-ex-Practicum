    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to prepare reports for the credit division of a bank. You will find out the effect of a customer's marital status and the number of children he has on the probability of defaulting on loan repayment. The bank already has some data regarding customer credit worthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report will be considered when making a **credit assessment** for potential customers. **credit scoring** is used to evaluate a potential borrower's ability to repay their loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to find out the effect of a customer's marital status and the number of children they have on the probability of default in repayment of credit bills by proving the following hypothesis:\n",
    "1. Loan failure occurs in customers who are married and have more than one child.\n",
    "2. Customers with *single* status regularly pay loans.\n",
    "3. Customers with incomes greater than average regularly pay loans.\n",
    "4. The purpose of the loan is a factor in loan failure."

    "\n",
    "Next, directly open the customer data in the form of the `credit_scoring_eng.csv` file. To resolve errors, you can call the customer data taken from *filepath* `/datasets/credit_scoring_eng.csv` and save it in the df variable."

It is possible that the float data occurred because the input data was calculated in units of hours, so it needed to be converted into days in `integer` form. However, this action will be carried out after there has been treatment of the missing data in this column.\n",

For missing data in the 'dob_years' and 'total_income' columns, replace the null values with the median of each group of data in each column value. The median value is chosen based on graphic trend analysis, which shows a skewed data distribution.\n",
